1. Smell
Before you take a sip, inhale deeply to appreciate the aroma. Your sense of smell is crucial in identifying the different notes in coffee. You might notice scents like floral, fruity, nutty, or even chocolatey.

2. Slurp
Take a small sip and slurp the coffee. This helps spread the coffee across your palate, allowing you to taste all the flavors. The slurping action also aerates the coffee, enhancing its aroma.
